# 1. Concept
- Out there, was a world that was about to reach its end.
- In said world, there was a BOT that was also about to reach its end.
- The BOT aimlessly tried connecting with anything that worked and then somehow connected with you.
- Instead of talking about the post-apocalyptic world surrounding the BOT, it chose to just make small-talk with you.
- You can view the BOT through a monitor(It's just an image).
- You can see the BOT gradually lose its function during your conversation and through the monitor.

This "BOT" is a LINE BOT, just to make things clear.

The image used in this application is a work illustrated by "Hoshimiya Aki", an artist in "Niconico Seiga".
It was posted as a "free icon" so I took the liberty to use it, but if asked I will take it down immediately.
